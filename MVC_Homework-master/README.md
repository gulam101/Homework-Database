# MVC_Homework

### Description:

I was practising using ASP.Net and understanding the MVC controller. I learned about how to make the front-end pretty. I played around with the backend, for example, playing with the database and giving it information.

I learned about what MVC stands for: Model-View-Controller.

I also played around with the ViewBag function which is used in ASP.Net and I know how to temporary transfer data from different classes using the ViewBag function.

I played around with the different settings such as the difference between the API and the empty controller. I learned about the scaffholding and populating it with the code so that I can call data from any class.

I got used to refrencing my classes so that I can see data from class A while I am working in class B. (The name of the classes were just used as examples) 

My goal for this project was to understand how ASP.Net worked and get used to the server-sided language such as Razor. In this project, you can see that I was playing around with the data.

I also worked with a little bit of JavaScript so that I can get used to using it.

- Understanding classes and referencing them better

- Better understanding ASP.Net
